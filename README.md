"# SignPDF" 
Very old .NET software (2011), apparently still compiling and working.

It signs with PAdES or CAdES (B or T level) standars.

Used to sign multiple pdfs at once, with visible or invisible mark.

For single PDF the mark can be placed freely, supporting custom underground image (it can be scan of physical signature).
